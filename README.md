# InnoGotchiFrontend
Frontend part of InnoGotchi game. Before starting this project you need to configure and start backend project([link to backend project](https://github.com/Zhigadlo/InnoGotchiBackend)) and set up variables in 
file appsettings.json in this project. There are a few variables in this file. You need to configure BaseAddress - it must contain address of started backend project.
There are another 3 variables that need to be configured - GameYearDays, FeedingsPerRealDay and DrinkingPerRealDay. They are responsible for game time configuration.
After setting up all the variables you can start project. The rules of game described inside the game. I wish that interface is intuitive 🌝 .And the final step is 
enjoing the game :) or find some bugs in it 😰
