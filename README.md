# InnoGotchiFrontend
Frontend part of InnoGotchi game. Before starting this project you need to configure and start backend project([link to backend project](https://github.com/Zhigadlo/InnoGotchiBackend)) and set up variables in 
file appsettings.json in this project. There are a few variables in this file. You need to configure BaseAddress - it must contain address of started backend project.
There are another 3 variables that need to be configured - GameYearDays, FeedingsPerRealDay and DrinkingPerRealDay. They are responsible for game time configuration.
After setting up all the variables you can start project. The rules of game are very simple. First you need to create your farm. After that you can make you some pets. The goal of the game is to keep your pets alive. They became thirsty and hungry by time and you need to feed them. Very simple:) I wish that interface is intuitive üåù .And the final step is 
enjoing the game :) or find some bugs in it üò∞
